# Azure-Resource-Drift-Detector

Detect meaningful divergence from approved Azure baselines quickly and route it to accountable owners.

## Example synopsis

A scheduled baseline comparison produces tenant-scoped, deduplicated drift evidence and an approved notification plan without embedding credentials or enabling public access.

## Real-world scenario

Emergency fixes and portal edits gradually move an estate away from its secure IaC baseline. The detector uses Resource Graph-scale inventory to identify material drift quickly and route it to accountable owners.

## Architecture

Scheduled Functions or Automation execute versioned Resource Graph queries and compare normalized snapshots with policy-as-data. New drift opens a deduplicated alert and optional Teams notification; resolved drift closes automatically with evidence.

Primary services: `Resource Graph`, `Azure Automation`, `Logic Apps`, `Teams`, `Storage`.

This repository implements the first production-oriented vertical slice: a
fail-closed, adapter-neutral control plane that validates tenant scope,
freshness, approvals, secretless identity, private access, and the exact
project action before producing a deterministic execution plan. Azure adapters
consume that plan; they are deliberately outside the local simulator so local
tests cannot claim a live cloud change occurred.

## Quickstart

Requirements: Python 3.11+ and Git. No Azure credentials are required.

```bash
./scripts/validate.sh
python3 src/control_plane.py --request examples/approved-request.json
```

The command emits canonical JSON with a stable idempotency key. The denied
fixture exits with status 2 and explains the failed invariants.

## Security boundaries

- Managed identity or workload identity only; embedded credentials are denied.
- Public network access and stale evidence are denied.
- Production and break-glass targets require explicit approval.
- The IaC entry point is opt-in and defaults to deploying nothing.
- Evidence output contains identifiers and decisions, never credential values.

## Verification and limitations

Local validation covers 13 tests, deterministic replay, JSON parsing, Python
compilation, ignore hygiene, and Bicep compilation when a compiler is present.
It does **not** prove Azure deployment, service licensing, quota, data-plane
permissions, provider/API availability, cloud failover, load, cost, or teardown.
See [[`docs/test-matrix.md`](docs/test-matrix.md)](docs/test-matrix.md) and [[`docs/runbook.md`](docs/runbook.md)](docs/runbook.md) before any integration trial.
